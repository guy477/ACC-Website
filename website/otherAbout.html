    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>In this section of my website I will be including my hobbies and other stuff I like to do outside of school and work. This ranges from doing multiple sports, what I like to watch, and what music I am into. One thing about me that hasn't changed
      through all the years is how much different stuff I like to learn about and how interested I am in trying new subjects of learning or skills.

    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Snowboarding</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>The first time I ever went snowboarding was when I was 12 and since then I have been intrigued by the sport, however the second time I went was when I was 20 and now I go constantly. Learning how to snowboard was relatively easy since I have experience
      in other board sports, and yet it still took some time to get. Being able to freely ride down a mountain and make your own path is one of the main factors why I snowboard so much. Its a sense of freedom and fun that doesn't come with other regular sports
      that are usually team sports and bounded to a certain area. I ride a Salomon The Villian 155 which is also my first board. So far the mountains that I have been to range from Colorado to places like Chile, one of the best mountains I have been on is
      the Big 3 in Banff Canada. I don't actively seek to go down blacks since I like to do more freeriding than just bombing it down hills, having fun on the terrain you can make is where I usually will be on the mountain.

    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Surfing</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>My father has been surfing since he was in his teens and wanted to teach me how to surf, which I do enjoy surfing through my own ways as well. Being in the ocean is freeing and getting past the break of a wave and into the back of a line up is a feeling
      that doesnt have an exact equal to. Although I will say I am not the best at surfing I still love to watch surfing competitions and whatever videos I can find on youtube about surfing. I've surfed in England, Mexico, and California but have yet to surf in
      gulf coast since there are rarely any good waves down here. Whilst in California I surfed from waking up to sunset and watching the sunset as you are in the back of set felt unreal and was one of the most beautiful things I've seen. The ocean was just
      still and silent, as the the sunset over the shinning water. It is more than words can descirbe and how it feels. I use at the moment my longboard plus one of my father's old shortboards depending on the days we go out surfing.

    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Skateboarding</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>Whilist in highschool I got into skateboarding and stuck with it for about a year until other people stopped skating as much and I had no one to skate with, however I have recently gotten back into skateboarding and do it regularly. On the weekends I'm
      usaully out practing a new trick or just riding around. On campus I usually skate between my classes and around northgate. While I had a couple years of not skating I still watched major competitions like the x-games and the vans series, which kept me
      intrigued enough to stay into the sport and give it another try. Now I usally skate most days whether it be just to class or at the skatepark.

    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Soccer</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>From elementary school up unitl 9th grade of highschool I was on soccer teams and enjoyed playning, but after a while I decided to give up on being on teams and just do it for fun. Now I usually schedule times with friends to go play soccer at random
      fileds and other places. I may not be as good as the others since they stayed on teams until senior year of highschool but it is just as fun doing a friendly competition as it was to do actually competitions with teams. If there are any events at A&M
      that have soccer I usually try to get a group together to play or find a group that is wanting to play, but I still mainly do it for fun.

    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">What I Listen To</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>Starting from a young age I listend to rock and punk music, and a couple of my favourite bands are: Foo Fighters, Green Day, Blink-182, Red Hot Chilli Peppers, and The Thermals. My music taste hasn't changed over the years as much, and I will generally
    listen to anything since I am open to all music. In my middle school and highschool years I listend to a lot of pop-punk and hard rock music, but then I went back to casual rock for a while. A year or go I started getting into old school R&B and also Jazz
    music, trying to broaden my taste in music. And recently I have been listenin to Ounk, Grunge, and Midwest Emo, all of which are amoung my favourite types of music. I also listen to music all the time, last year I put 69,000 hours into one streaming service
    for my music and discovered more than one artist per day of the year. So far each year has been increasing in numbers so for 2020 we will see what comes of it. A list of my favourite genres now are: Grunge, Punk, Rock, Shoegaze, and Midwest Emo.

   <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">What I Play</h2>
   <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
   <p>At the moment the only instrument I know how to play is the guitar, but I am trying to learn Bass and Piano at some point this year. I first started learning how to play guitar when I was in middle school but after about 4 months I gave up. I tried again a
     year later and stayed with it for about 6 months and gave up again. The biggest factor to giving up then was that I didn't know that I had to practice as much as I had to. I instantly thought I would get better after a couple days, however I know now that
     isn't the case. over the course of the years I would pick up the guitar here and there and play a couple things, but never enough to really get back into it. In 2019 around April I picked it back up again and decided I would continue playing every day for a
     while since it was one of my resolutions for the year, and I am now coming up to a year of playing almost daily. At first I practiced about 1 hour a day and then bumped it up to about 2 hours a day, and during the summer I bumped it up to about 6 hours a
     day of playing. I am now coming up to a year of playing guitar and I feel like I have improved significantly, but I still have a long way to go. At the moment the guitar I use is a Fender Telecaster HH model, the amp is a line 6 spider, and the pedals I
     have are a ProCo Rat and a Ibanez ts9. The music I usually try to play is a bit of rock and Grunge, but I do play other genres when I feel like it.

    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Concerts</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>I went to my first concert when I was 10 years old and it was one of the best concerts I have been to. It was a 2009 Green Day concert at the Toyota Center with my father and a couple other people, and ever since I wanted to go to more concerts. So far I
      have seen Green Day twice, Foo Fighters twice, Red Hot Chilli Peppers once, and countless other bands. I usually like to go see small bands play since fees to get in can range anywhere from 5 dollars to 30 dollars, which is comparatively cheaper than
      other concerts that cost close to 100 dollars. Over the summer of 2019 I saw about 7 bands perform and then went to a couple others during the school year. There are a couple concerts in 2020 that I will probably try and go see whether they come to
      Houston or Austin. I also have been to a couple festivals, my first being ACL when I was a junior in highschool.
